##A tiny app that delivers fresh news

This is a web app built with AngularJS that fetches RSS feeds and sends them through the Google Feed API. I'm making it for myself and a bunch of fellow expats from Portugal.

###Get started

1. Clone the repo
2. Hit ```npm install``` and then ```bower install``` to grab all dependencies
2. All set, go: ```grunt serve``` 

###To-do

1. Use [PhantomJS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20173928/how-to-get-the-html-source-of-a-website-with-phantomjs) to grab [newspaper covers](http://jornais.sapo.pt/nacional/4090)
2. Come up with a decent logo
3. It app.js gets too big, split in different files
4. Cut down unused bootstrap dependencies
